Building on Linux or MinGW
--------------------------

Just run


make


If you'd like to build a shared library on Linux run


make LIBSLAS_SHARED=1


Building a shared library (.dll) is not supported on Windows.  If you'd like
to know why we don't build a shared library on Windows just search the 
interwebs for __declspec.  There really shouldn't be any reason to build this
as a shared library.  After all, it's pretty tiny.



Installing
----------

Just copy the resulting libslas.a file (or libslas.so if you built it as a
shared library on Linux) to one of your normal library directories.  On Linux
that could be /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib where it will be found automatically.
If you don't put it in /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib you need to add the
directory where you put it to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/WHEREVER_YOU_PUT_LIBSLAS:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

On Windows you need to put it somewhere in your PATH or add the location to
your PATH environment variable.



Development
-----------

If you want to compile other programs that use libslas you will need to add:

-L/WHEREVER_YOU_PUT_LIBSLAS

to the linker options in your Makefile for programs that need to use it.  You
will also need to copy the libslas.h file to one of the standard include
directories (like /usr/local/include or /usr/include) or, if you put them
somewhere else, add:

-I/WHEREVER_YOU_PUT_LIBSLAS_H

to the compiler options in your Makefile for programs that need to use it.
